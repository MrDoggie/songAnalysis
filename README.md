NLP Analysis on Chinese Songs with THULAC Toolkit
THULAC is an NLP toolkit that is easy to use while maintain a high level of accuracy in parsing.
You can find the toolkit over here: http://thulac.thunlp.org/
However, the toolkit has limited its function to parsing (or you can say it concentrates all its energy on parsing).
As a result, the toolkit needs some setup before usage.
However, it is obvious that many of the setups are redundent and there might be some traps if you are not 
familiar with the toolkit or you are a beginner. For example: If you are using Python2, it is very likely that 
the chinese character printed out is unreadable code. I encountered the same problem during my work.
Therefore I wish my code may provide some extents of help.

Module needed:
THULAC
Pyecharts (for visualization)

Both of these could be attained using $sudo pip install
